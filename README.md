# Session 9 Assignment

**Goal is to create a network that**
1. has the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (No MaxPooling, but 3 3x3 layers with stride of 2 instead) 
2. total RF must be more than 44
3. one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution
4. one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
5. use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)
6. use argumentation library and apply:
    - horizontal flip
    - shiftScaleRotate
    - coarseDropout (max_holes = 1, max_height=16px, max_width=16px, min_holes = 1, min_height=16px, min_width=16px, fill_value=(mean of your dataset), mask_fill_value = None)
7. achieve 85% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 200k.

------
## transforms.py
The file contains albumentations trasforms which are applied to the input dataset

## dataset.py
CustomCIFAR10Dataset is created on top of CIFAR10 to take care of albumentation transform

## utils.py
The file contains utility & helper functions needed for training & for evaluating our model.

## S9.ipynb
The file is an IPython notebook. The notebook imports helper functions from utils.py.

## How to setup
### Prerequisits
```
1. python 3.8 or higher
2. pip 22 or higher
```

It's recommended to use virtualenv so that there's no conflict of package versions if there are multiple projects configured on a single system. 
Read more about [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). 

Once virtualenv is activated (or otherwise not opted), install required packages using following command. 

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running IPython Notebook using jupyter
To run the notebook locally -
```
$> cd <to the project folder>
$> jupyter notebook
```
The jupyter server starts with the following output -
```
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///<path to home folder>/Library/Jupyter/runtime/nbserver-71178-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=64bfa8105e212068866f24d651f51d2b1d4cc6e2627fad41
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=64bfa8105e212068866f24d651f51d2b1d4cc6e2627fad41
```

Open the above link in your favourite browser, a page similar to below shall be loaded.

![Jupyter server index page](https://github.com/piygr/s5erav1/assets/135162847/40087757-4c99-4b98-8abd-5c4ce95eda38)

- Click on the notebook (.ipynb) link.

A page similar to below shall be loaded. Make sure, it shows *trusted* in top bar. 
If it's not _trusted_, click on *Trust* button and add to the trusted files.

Now, the notebook can be operated from the action panel.

Happy Modeling :-)
